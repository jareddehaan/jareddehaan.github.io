<p>Illinois was a heavy favorite to win the 2021 NCAA Basketball National Championship but instead got ousted by the NCAA powerhouse Loyola Chicago in the Round of 32. I will be digging deep into stats to discover exactly why Illinois exited the tournament earlier than expected.</p>
<p>I first loaded four libraries that I might need for my data into my project.</p>

<p>I loaded my data sets that I will be using to prove that Illinois missed their shot at an NCAA Championship, but was Illinois really that good this year? Illinois was a #1 seed and ranked 2nd in the AP Poll entering the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>Very early on in the Loyola Chicago Round of 32 game, it was very clear Illinois was outmatched, outplayed and would inevitably lose to the Ramblers. As an Illinois fan, I began to cry with about 6 minutes left because I knew we were gonna lose in the year everything seemed to go our way. Pure chaos is what I should have expected during March Madness.</p>

<p>I noticed I had 5 columns that were not needed so I used select() to take those 5 columns and remove them from both of my data frames.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>collegebballstats &lt;- collegebballstats %&gt;% select(-X9, -X12, -X15, -X18, -X21)
oppbballstats &lt;- oppbballstats %&gt;% select(-X9, -X12, -X15, -X18, -X21)</code></pre>
<p>The two data sets I’ll be using show the basic season stats of the team while the other shows the seasons stats of their opponents. I got this data for this season’s stats from the Sports Reference’s college basketball site. I used left_join to merge the two data sets together. I’ll be mainly focusing on turnovers by Illinois compared to the rest of the NCAA as well as Illinois’ free throw percentage in comparison to other teams this season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>collegestats&lt;- collegebballstats %&gt;% left_join(oppbballstats, by=&quot;School&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a closer look into the turnovers forced and given up by teams. I’m interested to see how Illinois stacks up with the rest of the NCAA when it comes to forcing turnovers and giving up turnovers. I had to mutate the data to get the Turnovers per game and Turnovers forced per game. To do this I took TeamTOV (TeamTotalTurnovers) divided by G.x (Games played) to find Turnovers per game. I also took OppTOV (OpponentTurnovers) divided by G.x (Games played) to find Turnovers forced per game.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>turnovers &lt;- collegestats %&gt;%
  mutate(Turnoverspergame = TeamTOV/G.x) %&gt;% mutate(TurnoversForcedpergame = OppTOV/G.x) %&gt;% filter(G.x &gt; 10)</code></pre>
<p>I created four new data frames of teams I wanted to focus on as well. Gonzaga and Baylor were 1 seeds that were the overall one and two seed in the NCAA Tournament (Illinois was number 3.) Loyola Chicago is the team that eliminated Illinois from March Madness in a 71-58 win.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ill &lt;- turnovers %&gt;% filter(School == &quot;Illinois NCAA&quot;)
zag &lt;- turnovers %&gt;% filter(School == &quot;Gonzaga NCAA&quot;)
bay &lt;- turnovers %&gt;% filter(School == &quot;Baylor NCAA&quot;)
loy &lt;- turnovers %&gt;% filter(School == &quot;Loyola (IL) NCAA&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>To find the vline (x intercept) and hline (y intercept). I found the Average Turnovers forced by taking the mean of the TurnoversForcedpergame for all 356 teams. I also found the teams’ Average turnovers per game by taking the mean of the Turnoverspergame for all 356 teams.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>avgtoforced &lt;- turnovers %&gt;% summarise(
    AvgTOforced = mean(TurnoversForcedpergame))
avgtopergame &lt;- turnovers %&gt;% summarise(
    Avgtopergame = mean(Turnoverspergame))</code></pre>
<p>The first question we’ll look at is how good was Illinois compared to the rest of the NCAA. I will also pull 3 other teams from the NCAA to compare to Illinois. Those teams are Gonzaga, Baylor and Loyola Chicago.</p>

If you look at the graph, you’ll see that both 1 seeds seeded ahead of Illinois are far into the Good Team Turnovers and Good Turnovers Forced section. This means that they are good at handling the ball and do a very good job of forcing their opponents to give up the ball. Loyola Chicago is in this category as well. If you forgot from earlier, Loyola is the team that beat Illinois in the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. So these three times are in the Good, Good section. Where is Illinois? If you look to the left of Baylor, Gonzaga and Loyola Chicago, you will find Illinois in the Good Team Turnovers and Bad Turnovers Forced section.They are hovering the line of Bad, Bad. This seems highly odd that the team ranked 2nd in the nation would be hovering on the Bad Team Turnovers and Bad Turnovers Forced line. This leads me to think that Illinois may have overperformed this year based on this graphic.</p>
